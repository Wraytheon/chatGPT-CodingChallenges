Create a function called isPalindrome that takes in a string as an argument and returns a boolean indicating whether the string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

You should implement the following steps:

Create a function isPalindrome(str)
Convert the string to lowercase using the toLowerCase() method.
Remove all non-alphanumeric characters using a regular expression.
Use the split(), reverse() and join() methods to reverse the string and compare it to the original string.
Return true if the reversed string is equal to the original string, otherwise return false.
